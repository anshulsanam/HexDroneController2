Drone app

This android app goes along with the Modular Drone. It is able to control the drone with the built in orientation sensing abilities of a smartphone
or the two joysticks provided.

The Bluetooth Low Energy code is based on [Google's BluetoothLeGatt sample app/code](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-BluetoothLeGatt)

Also, in a recent hackathon I added the ability to interface with the [Myo Armband](https://www.myo.com/) to control the drone through arm movements and finger motion.
